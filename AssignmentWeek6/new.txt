Line 1------>With the causes of my first plunge into the troubled waters of trade at
Line 2------>the early age of nine I have here nothing to do. It must suffice to say
Line 3------>that one spring morning, over forty years ago, I entered the emporium
Line 4------>of an oil, colour, and Italian warehouseman (to quote from his fascia),
Line 5------>in what was then known as Kensal New Town, a neighbourhood that had
Line 6------>long been of unsavoury reputation, but was emerging into something
Line 7------>like respectability by the aid of sundry long rows of jerry-built,
Line 8------>stucco-ornamented houses, the inhabitants of which tried hard to forget
Line 9------>the former appellation of their chosen abiding-place, and dated their
Line 10------>letters, when they wrote any, from Upper Westbourne Park.
Line 11------>
Line 12------>Mingled with the rows of mean streets of private dwellings were a few
Line 13------>scattered shops tenanted by brave and daring folk who lived principally
Line 14------>upon hope and a little capital. One of these had established himself
Line 15------>between a butcher and a baker, and having laid in a stock of the
Line 16------>amazingly miscellaneous description which characterises what we in
Line 17------>London call, _tout court_, an "oil shop," awaited local custom. But
Line 18------>having no children to assist him, and his wife being fully occupied
Line 19------>with household duties, he sought additional help, and I obtained the
Line 20------>situation. How vivid and fresh is the recollection of my opening morn!
Line 21------>With what awe did I gaze upon the closely packed shop, wondering
Line 22------>however mortal mind could tell where everything was stowed; how
Line 23------>curiously did I sniff the mingled odours of paint, soap, paraffin,
Line 24------>glue, dog-biscuit, size, etc., all combined by the piney scent of the
Line 25------>newly chopped wood which was stacked in halfpenny bundles up against
Line 26------>the counter.
